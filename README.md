# GANs-in-action
Pytorch implementations from the book GANs in Action

This is Pytorch implementation of the code from *GANs in Action Deep Learning with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)*  by Manning Books.

This code was implemented from the [following code](https://github.com/GANs-in-Action/gans-in-action/blob/master/chapter-2/Chapter_2_Autoencoder.ipynb), which is written by [Jakub Langr](https://github.com/jakubLangr) and [Vladimir Bok](https://github.com/vbok).

Like the code mentioned before , This was implemented at Google Colabotory.

The goal I aimmed for was studying Pytorch in comparison with Tensorflow.keras

For Rerunning the code, This code was built in torch 1.6.0
